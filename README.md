# **IIIT-YONO**

Do we sound familiar? Well, someone on campus stole our branding (remember the guy infront of C-6 ðŸ˜‰) <br>
Anyways, time for intros (ringing any bells?):
> Namaste Sir, my name is IIIT YONO. I belong to the 'website' branch. I am from Hyderabad, Telangana. My hobbies are helping people navigate around the campus, help TAs assign slots for live evals and sprinkle some Nimbu Pani from JC to de-stress you. <br>
> Now for the most important question, "maine zindagi mein kya ukhadda hai?"
>> "maine poora Vindhya navigate kar liya, wo bhi akele ðŸ˜Ž"

And being part of the college, I'm still learning. Abhi assignment hai, baad mein baad karte hain
